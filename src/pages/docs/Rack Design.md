### Mack Rack
I found this design on Thingiverse and chose to use it because the 2020 aluminum extrusion would make the build very flexible and durable. This design also had a lot of room for customization, as all of the side components could be 3d printed and there are many options for anodized aluminum rails. I chose a electric blue for the rails and a translucent PETG for the 3d printed components.
