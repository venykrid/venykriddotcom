The first custom bay I made for the [[Rack Design|rack]] was a 1U drive bay supporting 2 3.5" full-sized hard drives in my 10" rack. 
### Prototype

- This design is very simple and tight, 2 drives are set in and sit on foam strips for isolation and connect via a powered USB SATA adapter to the Mini PC
- It's more than capable of supporting the hard drives
